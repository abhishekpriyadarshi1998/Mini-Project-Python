This python code is a banking program which provides basic banking operations such as opening accounts, making deposits, withdrawing money, and checking account balances. 
The code is broken down into classes which include an Account class, a Checking class, a Saving class, a Business class, and a Customer class.

The Account class is the abstract base class which contains the __init__ and __str__ methods which are used to initialize and print the attributes of an account. 
It also contains two methods, deposit and withdrawl, which are used to handle deposits and withdrawals respectively.

The Checking, Saving, and Business classes are all subclasses of Account which handle specific account types. Each class contains an __init__ method 
which calls the __init__ method from the Account class and a __str__ method which returns the bank statement as a string.

The Customer class contains an __init__ method which initializes the name and pin of the customer and a dictionary of accounts (C, S, and B)
which keep track of the customer's accounts. It also contains methods for opening checking, saving, and business accounts.

The main function contains several helper functions used to handle the various banking operations. 
It also contains a loop which allows the user to select the service they would like to use (banking or ATM). 
The banking option allows the user to open a new account, deposit money into an existing account, and check their total deposits in all accounts. 
The ATM option allows the user to withdraw money from an existing account.
